mithical: a magical engine of progress
---------------------

Currently being hosted at [spire.sg](http://spire.sg). This project may be renamed to match soon. 


#### Here's the dream:

* Should show *progress*. This is the most important feature to this tool. Calculating progress based off a percentage of tasks completed is perhaps not the most accurate way, but it makes it easy to visualize progress.

* Should be more flexible than the traditional todo list. Think of a notepad- you can write whatever you want, leave yourself whitespace between lines, and items/descriptions can be nested.

* In the future, lists should be shareable. As of right now, the goal is to simply save lists in the user's browser.

* Would love to introduce a mobile version. 

* Integration with other services- I want to keep this simple, but at the same time it could be a whole lot more useful if I could figure out a way to integrate Google Calendar, for example.
